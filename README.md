# EORhythm

This is a very old game I made back in 2015. It was the first game I ever finished (well, first game outside of a console window, anyway).

The files of the original finished version have been lost over time, though I still have a compiled .jar file which can be used to play the game. The files here are from an older version, mostly uploaded for nostalgia purposes.

Here is the (finished) game in action:

The songs from the gif are:

* Calling that Detestable Name from Etrian Odyssey III: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_0TeykT5NA
