# EORhythm

This is a very old game I made back in 2015. It was the first game I ever finished (well, first game outside of a console window, anyway).

The files of the original finished version have been lost over time, though I still have a compiled .jar file which can be used to play the game. The files here are from an older version, mostly uploaded for nostalgia purposes.

Here is the (finished) game in action:

It's less laggy in real life than in the gif, of course.

The songs from the gif are:
* Molten Caves from Etrian Odyssey III: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daSblMlpi3c
* Calling that Detestable Name from Etrian Odyssey III: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_0TeykT5NA

Funnily enough, at the time that I created this game (and named the tracks in the menus), there was no official translation of the Japanese names for the tracks, which is why they are slightly off (Caverns of Splendor instead of Molten Caves for instance).
